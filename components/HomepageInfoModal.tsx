                    <span>Qi, inspired by Feng Shui and the Chinese Zodiac, is a unique NFT project that blends the artistry of tokenized assets with DeFi mechanics. When you mint a Yiqi NFT, you{"'"}ll receive two tokens, a unique Avatar and a Background, each drawn from an extensive and beautifully crafted collection. These represent the Chinese Zodiac and Feng Shui symbols, each with their own qualities and traits.</span>

                    <span>A treasury system has been established that benefits NFT holders. Whenever an NFT is minted or a secondary sale occurs, the respective fees are deposited into the treasury, contributing to its growth. The treasury{"'"}s balance is then converted into liquid staked ETH (stETH), a yield-generating asset. This process creates a treasury value proportional to the outstanding NFTs. If a user decides to burn their NFT, they can redeem a proportional share of the treasury{"'"}s value. However, a 5% burn fee is applied to incentivize holding your NFTs, which is then deposited back into the treasury. This system creates a self-sustaining economic model that not only benefits the NFT holders but also aligns the interests of all parties involved in the project. Furthermore, 2% of the treasury{"'"}s annual yield is sent to the YAM Treasury, and another 2% is paid to the NFT Team to maintain project infrastructure.</span>

                    <span>With a fixed supply of 8888 NFTs, we provide an opportunity for everyone to get involved. Each mint will cost 0.1 ETH. Apart from providing you with a unique and beautiful digital asset, your mint fee contributes to the treasury, directly increasing the value of your NFT.</span>

                    <span>The burn functionality offers Qi NFT holders a unique mechanism to redeem value from their NFTs. It allows NFT holders to destroy, or {'"burn",'} their NFTs in exchange for a proportional value of the treasury. This burn feature essentially allows users to redeem the value of their NFT, minus a small 5% fee that is left in the treasury. This fee discourages continuous and repetitive minting and burning, thus promoting stability in the NFT ecosystem of the project. The burn feature provides an exit strategy for NFT holders, making the Qi NFT project a dynamic and liquid NFT marketplace.</span>
