                        At Yiqi, we have built an innovative DeFi ecosystem around our NFTs. When you mint a Yiqi NFT, youÂ´ll receive two unique tokens, an Avatar and a Background, each drawn from an extensive and beautifully crafted collection. These represent the Chinese Zodiac and Feng Shui symbols, each with their own qualities and traits.

                        A treasury system has been established that benefits NFT holders. All minting fees and royalties are deposited into a treasury which can be withdrawn proportionally by burning your NFT. Additionally, a small 5% burn fee has been implemented to incentivize holding your NFTs. This means that as more NFTs are minted and traded, the value of the treasury grows.

                    <Text mb={2}>
                        With a fixed supply of 8888 NFTs, we provide an opportunity for everyone to get involved. Each mint will cost 0.1 ETH. Apart from providing you with a unique and beautiful digital asset, your mint fee contributes to the treasury, directly increasing the value of your NFT.
